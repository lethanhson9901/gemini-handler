--- V.C.2 System Instructions ---
Response with System Instruction:
Okay, imagine you're working on a school project, and you keep saving different versions of your document like "essay_v1.doc", "essay_v2.doc", "essay_final.doc", "essay_really_final.doc", etc. Version control systems like Git automate and massively improve this process, especially when working on software.

Here are the main benefits:

*   **Keeps a History of Everything:** Git records *every* change you make to your project over time. You can see exactly what was changed, when, and who changed it.
*   **Go Back to Any Point:** Made a mistake? Broke something? You can easily "travel back in time" and restore your project to an earlier state where everything was working. It's like a super-powered undo button for your entire project.
*   **Makes Teamwork Easy:** Multiple people can work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other's work. Git helps merge everyone's changes together smoothly and helps resolve conflicts if they happen.
*   **Experiment Safely:** You can create separate "branches" to try out new features or fix bugs without affecting the main, stable version of your project. If your experiment doesn't work, you can just discard the branch. If it works, you can easily add it to the main project.
*   **Understand Changes:** You can see exactly *who* changed *what* line of code and *why* (if commit messages are good). This is invaluable for understanding how the project evolved and tracking down issues.
*   **Acts as a Backup:** While not its primary purpose, Git often stores your project's history in multiple places (like on your computer and a service like GitHub or GitLab), providing a form of backup.

In short, Git helps you track, manage, and collaborate on your code more effectively and safely.

``` python
import math

n = 15
factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial_n}")

```
```
The factorial of 15 is 1307674368000

```
The factorial of 15 is 1,307,674,368,000.

I calculated this using the following Python code:

``` python
import math

n = 15
factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
print(factorial_n)

```
```
1307674368000

```
